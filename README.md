The following repository tells about my PowerBI project done on the US_Regional_Sales_Data. 

#Explaination
Data importd from a Excel file to poweBI 
Data cleaned with powerBI query language DAX

#Dashboard componants
Annual sales -- I used slicer in a list format. There was not any specific column for year it was extracted by me with the use of ordered_date column

Profit-- I use card visualiser which gives a static value representation

Sales Medium-- The was a column in data named as sales channel which I used as a sales medium .It represents that sale was either through online/instore/distributor or holesale.

State Wise Sales-- It represents the top 5 max selling state according to the respective year and the product also. For visualization I preferred Stacked Area Chard.

Product-- It represents the product names in slicer drop down format .
